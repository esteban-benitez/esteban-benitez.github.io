I"<p>Have you ever swam in the Pacific Ocean?  When compared to the northern Atlantic regions of the East coast of the United States of America, the Pacific Ocean is extremely cold, even in summer.  Because of this constant cold water, El Nino was a phenomenon characterized by it’s English translation of “The Little Boy”, and was fairly prevalent for much of current history, due to unaturally warm ocean water in the Pacific.  The increase in ocean temparature causes changes in seasonal temporal, and weather patterns.  With global warming a past due issue that needs to managed, what sort of variations are caused by El Nino, and what may be transcribed for the future?</p>

<p>The Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree Program’s Project - 1 is based on the following El Nino data set obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/El+Nino)  El Nino Data Set is a set of suface/oceanographic meteorological readings taken from a 59 buoys normaly distributed positions throughout the equatorial Pacific.  The (TAO) or Tropical Atmospher Ocean consists of 70 buoys, yet this data set only has 59 with an average of 7 days of data based on the following attributes: zonal winds, meridonal winds, humidity, air tempature, and sub surface temperature, and described as below.</p>

<p>Just where are these buoys located exactly?  They are found at the intersection of the latitude and longitude coordinates, marked by the red xs below.</p>

<p>Initial exploratory analysis indicates Buoy # 34 had a the highest humidity of 99.4 degrees, where the groups average was 84.5 degrees.  Buoy # 19 had a zonal wind of 7 meters per second in an eastern direction, where the average wind was 3.9 m/s in a western direction.  Buoy # 14 had a zonal wind of 7.1 m/s north, and the average was .6 m/s south.</p>

<p>Given that the buoy data the following normality analysis,</p>

<p>I was able to calculate a numerical correlation coefficient, or in the presence of non parametric data, a tau correlation coefficient, and reject the null hypothesis that the variables are not not linearly related.  The following plot illustrates the strength of existing linear relationships.</p>
